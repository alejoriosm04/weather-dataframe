## About project

-   üåé Analyze multiple data taken by NOAA
-   üåßÔ∏è Discover specific data like temperature or precipitation in a
    specific date
-   üå°Ô∏è Calculate the average temperature of your city
-   ü§î Take decisions based on predictions

This data frame will allow you to make different calculations with
multiple data taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). You will have multiple options of statistics
according to the filter that you want to give to the program.

## How does it work?

First of all, if you want to analyze a specific city that is not in the
default menu, you will have to extract all the necessary information
from [NOAA web page](https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov). However, you will need
to follow some standards to make it possible to read the file in the
best way. Then, add it to the project folder and finally, we will add to
the Options Menu in the Main screen. Subsequesntly, all the statistics
functions would work in the program.

After all this, you will see a menu with all the options and
capabilities of the program. Try to interact much as possible with the
program and discover it.

At the moment, the program offers only one filter options and two
statistic functions. The filter option is an specific date, that the
user choose and the program will compare all the data in the file with
this user date.

The statistic functions are average and maximum-minimum. The program
will print all the complete information about what you entered.

Finally, all the user interaction will be save in a `.txt` file, to have
the record of all.

## How to test it?

To test it, you have two options.

1\. Downloading all the files, doing a `git clone` in console. And
creating all the deveploment environment of Java.

2\. Going to our [Replit
Project](https://replit.com/@ariosm/Final-Project) and clicking on the
green button in the right corner of the screen. Let us to know your
opinions and comments there!
