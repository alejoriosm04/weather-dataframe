    About project
</h2> 
<ul>
    <li>üåé Analyze multiple data taken by NOAA</a></li>
    <li>üåßÔ∏è Discover specific data like temperature or precipitation in a specific date</li>
    <li>üå°Ô∏è Calculate the average temperature of your city</li>
    <li>ü§î Take decisions based on predictions</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This data frame will allow you to make different calculations with multiple data taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). You will have multiple options of statistics according to the filter that you want to give to the program.
</p>

<h2>
    How does it work?
</h2> 

<p>
    First of all, if you want to analyze a specific city that is not in the default menu, you will have to extract all the necessary information from <a href = "https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov">NOAA web page</a>. However, you will need to follow some standards to make it possible to read the file in the best way. Then, add it to the project folder and finally, we will add to the Options Menu in the Main screen. Subsequesntly, all the statistics functions would work in the program.
</p>
<p>
    After all this, you will see a menu with all the options and capabilities of the program. Try to interact much as possible with the program and discover it.
</p>
<p>
    At the moment, the program offers only one filter options and two statistic functions. The filter option is an specific date, that the user choose and the program will compare all the data in the file with this user date.
</p>
<p>
   The statistic functions are average and maximum-minimum. The program will print all the complete information about what you entered.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, all the user interaction will be save in a <code>.txt</code> file, to have the record of all.
</p>
<h2>
  How to test it?
</h2>
<p>
    To test it, you have two options.
</p>
<p>
    1. Downloading all the files, doing a <code>git clone</code> in console. And creating all the deveploment environment of Java.
</p>
<p>
    2. Going to our <a href = "https://replit.com/@ariosm/Final-Project">Replit Project</a> and clicking in the green button in the right corner of the screen. Let us to know your opinions and comments there!
