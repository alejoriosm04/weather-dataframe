## Features

-   🌎 Analyze multiple data taken by NOAA
-   🌧️ Discover specific data like temperature or precipitation in a
    specific date
-   🌡️ Calculate the average temperature of your city
-   🤔 Take decisions based on predictions

## How does it work?

1. First of all, if you want to analyze a specific city that is not in the
default menu, you will have to extract all the necessary information
from the [NOAA web page](https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov).
    - However, you will need to follow some standards to make
    it possible to read the file in the
    best way.
    - Then, add it to the project folder and finally, we will add it to
    the Options Menu in the Main screen.
    - Subsequently, all the statistics
    functions would work in the program.

2. After all this, you will see a menu with all the options and
capabilities of the program.
    - At the moment, the program offers only one filter options and two
    statistical functions.
    - The filter option is an specific date, that the
    user choose and the program will compare all the data in the file with
    this user date.
    - The statistical functions are
        - average
        - and maximum-minimum.

4. The program will print all the complete
information based on your input.

5. Finally, all the user interaction will be saved in a `.txt` file.

## Run

Two options:

1. `git clone` and create the Java environment (boo!).
